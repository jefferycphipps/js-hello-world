/*  
Welcome, new coder. 
Enter your code on line 7 to print 'Hello, World!' 
to the console (the panel on the right)
*/

console.log("Hello! I am Jeffery Phipps.");
console.log(17+2);
/*  
Next, PLAY! 
Modify your code on line 7 to try to accomplish the tasks listed below:

   1. Change the message that is printed.
   Hello to the console
   2. Figure out what the parentheses do. Will the code work without them?
   It lets the program know that the stuff in the middle is the parameter for the method/function.
   3. Remove one or both quotation marks. Do we need to include both opening and closing quote marks? Is there a difference between using a single or a double quote (' vs. ")?
   It did not change the program in this case. In other languages it might. 
   4. Remove the semi-colon, ;.
   The semicolon did not make a difference. In other languages it might.
   5. Print a number. (Bonus: Print two numbers added together).
   Done
   6. Print multiple messages one after the other.
   Done
   7. Print two messages on the same line.
   8. Print a message that contains quote marks, such as Quoth the Raven "Nevermore".
   9. Other. You choose!
